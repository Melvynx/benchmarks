# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Development servers

- Always use Portly (`portly ...`) to start, stop, restart, inspect, or keep local development servers running.
- Start with `portly status`. Use `portly status --details` only for the full inventory and metrics, and `--json` only for machine-readable fields. Reuse a healthy managed server; if an in-scope server is running outside Portly, register it and use `portly take-over <project/server> --json`.
- For long-lived or reusable work, create a project and server.
- For builds, tests, code generation, previews, demos, and other bounded one-off work, run `job_id="$(portly temp '<command>' --path <folder> --timeout 30m)"`, then `portly wait "$job_id"`. `temp` returns immediately with an ID; `wait` prints captured logs and exits with the command's real code. A timeout kills the whole process group and exits with code `124`.
- Never launch persistent development servers directly, in the background, or through another supervisor.
